# InstallPKG #

InstallPKG is an open source (GNU GPL) installation system for Apple Installer Packages (.pkg and .mpkg). InstallPKG provides a wrapper to the 'installer' tool on Mac OS X systems. The functionality is focused on allowing you to quickly install multiple packages to the current boot drive.

Use this project to build the OS X package installer for InstallPKG or download the .dmg file which is also available from github. 

Comments and suggestions regarding the InstallPKG project are very welcome.
