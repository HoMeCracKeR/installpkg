# InstallPKG #

InstallPKG is an open source (GNU GPL) installation system for Apple Installer Packages (.pkg and .mpkg). InstallPKG provides a wrapper to the 'installer' tool on Mac OS X systems. The functionality is focused on allowing you to quickly install multiple packages to the current boot drive.

Use this project to build the OS X package installer for InstallPKG or download the .dmg file which is also available from github. 

Support for URL install package source files is provided by wget. If you do not have wget installed on your system and you would rather not install the developer tools then download wget for OS X as a package from : http://rudix.org/packages/wget.html

Comments and suggestions regarding the InstallPKG project are very welcome.
